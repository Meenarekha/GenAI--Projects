            "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the mountains and the sea, there lived a kind and hardworking farmer named Tom. Tom spent his days tending to his fields, working tirelessly to ensure a good harvest for himself and his family.\n",
            "\n",
            "One day, as Tom was working in the field, he noticed a tiny bird that had fallen from its nest. The bird was injured and couldn't fly. Tom's heart went out to the poor creature and he carefully picked it up and brought it home.\n",
            "\n",
            "He made a little nest for the bird in a box and fed it tiny pieces of bread soaked in milk. Days went by, and the bird slowly regained its strength. Tom grew very fond of the little bird and named it Chirpy.\n",
            "\n",
            "One day, as Tom was walking Chirpy around the house, he overheard his wife speaking to a neighbor about their sizeable debt to the local moneylender. Tom rushed over and asked what was wrong. His wife explained that they had been unable to pay off their debt and the moneylender was demanding even more interest.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tom thought hard about what to do, and then he had an idea. He remembered how Chirpy would often chirp and flutter its wings as if to fly. Tom went to the village square and proclaimed that he was going to hold a contest to see who could fly highest. The villagers gathered, curious to see what Tom was up to.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tom let Chirpy out of its box and held it up high above his head. The little bird chirped loudly and fluttered its wings. Tom then announced that whoever could come up with the most creative solution to help him and his wife pay off their debt would receive Chirpy as a prize.\n",
            "\n",
            "The villagers thought it was just a silly game at first, but soon they came up with all sorts of creative ideas. Some offered to work for free, others offered to share their own debts, and some even offered money and goods.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the end, a kind old woman named Martha suggested that they put on a lion dance to collect donations from the villagers. The villagers loved the idea, and Tom and Martha organized the dance, which was a huge success. Tom and his wife were able to pay off their debt, and the whole village celebrated.\n",
            "\n",
            "And that's the story of Tom, the kind farmer who saved his village by using a tiny bird to bring them all together. The end.\n",
            "You: thank you\n",
            "AI:  You're welcome! I'm glad you enjoyed the story. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help! Have a great day! 😄\n",
            "You: exit\n",
